# Convert Database Character Set

Run, or generates, SQL script to convert a database from latin1 to UTF8, for "problematic" languages like Hebrew.


Address a probelm common in old MySQL DBs with Hebrew text data. While migrating to to ne DB, or upgrading to new version, the Hebrew would become gibberish (or question mark signs).



A very old script... written in the mid 2000's & last tested on 2011. May need updating, if at all relevant these days.
